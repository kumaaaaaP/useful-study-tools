            <p>
                Of course, one of the features of modern life, mostly thanks to the internet, is that we all have to constantly make choices about what to pay attention to — what to spend our time on, even if it is for just a few minutes. Many of us today have instant access to far more information than we can ever hope to process, which has meant that our average attention span is getting shorter. 
                <span class="underlined" id="q1"><u>(1) The more 'stuff' we have to think about and focus on, the less time we are able to devote to each particular thing.</u></span> 
                People are quick to blame the internet for this reduced attention span, but while social media certainly plays its part, it is not entirely to blame. This trend can be traced back to when our world first started to become connected early in the last century as technology gave us access to an ever-increasing amount of information.
            </p>

            <p>
                Today we are exposed to twenty-four-hour breaking news and an exponential rise in the amount of produced and consumed information. As the number of different issues that form our collective public discourse continues to increase, the amount of time and attention we are able to devote to each one inevitably gets compressed. 
                <span class="underlined" id="q2"><u>(2) It isn't that our total engagement with all this information is any less, but rather that as the information competing for our attention becomes denser our attention gets spread more thinly, with the result that public debate becomes increasingly fragmented and superficial.</u></span> 
                The more quickly we switch between topics, the more quickly we lose interest in the previous one. We then find ourselves increasingly engaging only with those subjects that interest us, leading us to become less broadly informed — and potentially less confident in evaluating information outside of the spheres with which we are most familiar.
            </p>

            <p>
                I am not advocating that we should all devote more time and attention to every topic we encounter, whether we are exposed to information through our family, friends or work colleagues, or by reading books and magazines, the mainstream media, online or on social media, as that would be impossible. But we must learn how to discriminate between what is important, useful and interesting, what is deserving of our attention and time, and what is not. As Feynman so emphatically pointed out, in his response to the journalist's request for a pithy summary of his Nobel Prize work, the topics we do choose to spend more time thinking about and digesting will inevitably require a certain level of commitment. In science, we know that to truly understand a subject requires time and effort. The reward is that concepts which may at first have seemed impenetrable turn out to be comprehensible, straightforward, sometimes even simple. At worst, we acknowledge that they are indeed complicated — not because we are unable to think them through thoroughly and make sense of them, but because they just are complicated.
            </p>

                So, this is the takeaway for us all in daily life. Do you need a PhD in climate science to know that recycling your rubbish is better for the planet than throwing it all in the ocean? Of course not. 
                <span class="underlined" id="q3"><u>(3) But taking some time to dig a little deeper into a subject and weighing up the evidence, the pros and cons about an issue, before making up your mind can help you make better decisions in the long run.</u></span>
            </p>

            <p>
                Most things in life are difficult to begin with. But, if you're prepared to try, you can cope with far more than you imagine.
